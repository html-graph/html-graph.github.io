**HTMLGraph** is a graph visualization library that enables rich node customization using HTML.
It allows you to create interactive and visually dynamic graphs by integrating HTML
elements directly into nodes, making it perfect for building complex and customizable visualizations.

This library features a low-level [core](/core-configuration) alongside practical
high-level functionalities, including [draggable nodes](/draggable-nodes),
a [shiftable and zoomable canvas](/transformable-viewport),
