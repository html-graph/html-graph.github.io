**HTMLGraph** is a graph visualization library that enables rich nodes customization using HTML.
It allows you to create interactive and visually dynamic graphs by integrating HTML
elements directly into nodes, making it perfect for building complex and customizable visualizations.

Here's an advanced example to demonstrate some capabilities of this library:

Alongside low-level core there are some built-in high level modules:
- [draggable nodes](/draggable-nodes)
- [shiftable and zoomable viewport](/transformable-viewport)
- [connectable ports](/connectable-ports)
- [background rendering](/background)
- [virtual scroll](/virtual-scroll)
- [resize-reactive nodes](/resize-reactive-nodes)

All examples are designed as single HTML files to simplify setup and usage.

To begin, check out the [getting started](/getting-started) guide.
